# Watch Ledger for Streamystats

Watch Ledger adds a daily viewing history, activity calendar, weekly/monthly recaps, manual logs, lists, ratings, and reversible corrections. Raw Sessions keeps the original playback records available.

## Installation

Run from the source checkout on your Docker host:

```bash
bash install-ledger.sh --check
bash install-ledger.sh --install
```

The installer discovers a single Compose `nextjs-app` container and the `job-server` and `vectorchord` containers in its project. For multiple installations or custom names, set `LEDGER_APP_CONTAINER`, `LEDGER_JOB_CONTAINER`, and `LEDGER_DB_CONTAINER`. It builds locally, briefly stops the apps, takes and validates a full PostgreSQL backup, and recreates only the two apps. Docker Compose V2 with `--wait` support is required. Keep the source directory and the printed backup location. Backups are excluded from Git and Docker build contexts. Do not use `docker compose down -v`.

`bash install-ledger.sh --rollback` restores the original Compose images. The additive ledger table is retained. Rollback does not delete imports or corrections.

## Users, imports, and settings

Open Watch Ledger and choose a user. Regular accounts can access themselves. Administrators can select another user after their current privileges are verified with Jellyfin. **Imports, manual logs, corrections, ratings, and settings belong to the selected user.** Selecting another user as an administrator lets you edit that user's ledger.

Import SIMKL JSON for episode history and CSV for list metadata. Import dates are retained as supplied. There is no setup-day cutoff and no automatic classification of older dates as estimated. Missing or sentinel dates remain unknown. Existing imports retain their original dates and are normalized on read without rewriting their source records. Old setup-day/estimated labels are no longer used. Imported and manual runtime remain separate from recorded Jellyfin playback; their cards identify their source. An import's runtime is a title-runtime total, not a playback measurement.

Imports are additive: an older backup cannot remove episodes found in an earlier upload. Reimporting the same episode retains its later available watch date. CSV supplies list status, ratings, and last-episode summaries; JSON supplies detailed history. Imports do not write to SIMKL or Jellyfin.

Completion defaults to 90%, timezone follows the server (UTC fallback), and confirmed prior titles start empty. These settings can be changed for the selected user. Confirmed prior titles are useful for undated prior viewings. Manual-log retries reuse one request identity; close the form before intentionally logging a different watch.

## Watches and corrections

Sessions for an unfinished episode are combined across pauses, days, and devices. Legacy recordings lack sufficient coverage data to reliably infer repeat viewings, so they are grouped conservatively and can be corrected manually. New recordings accumulate unique watched portions. A restart near the beginning after completion opens a tentative new watch, counted as a completed rewatch only after reaching the completion threshold.

Earlier days of a multi-day watch show In progress and its final day shows Completed. History's Watch status filter uses the whole watch's current status, so completed watches are excluded from In progress on every day. Search, media type, and date filters apply before pagination. History loads 100 cards per page; headline, activity, and recap totals use all matching supported history, not just that page. Lists show 100 titles per page.

Open a card's arrow menu to mark completion, change rewatch status/date, or hide the watch. Reset corrections to undo. Raw sessions are retained. Wrapped uses completed watches for its rewatch section; other upstream dashboard panels still use original session analytics.

## Limits

- Jellyfin's polled Sessions response does not provide seek events or playback speed. Coverage accepts plausible normal-speed progression and rejects obvious jumps. Subsecond seeks indistinguishable from polling jitter cannot be detected reliably. Faster playback can be undercounted; manual completion remains available.
- A final playback position is included when Jellyfin supplies a matching final observation. A vanished session supplies no final position, so the unobserved tail is not fabricated.
- Sessions spanning midnight are attributed to their start date.
- Reads are bounded to 50,000 sessions, 10,000 ledger records/series, and 32 MB of ledger JSON per user. Exceeding a limit shows an explicit error rather than silently truncating history. Imports exceeding the record/JSON limits roll back. Ledger builds use short-lived caching, compact projections, and paginated responses; unlimited-history materialized aggregates are not implemented.
- No live SIMKL/Trakt sync or external catalog search. Enter a title manually or use imported titles.
- Unknown episode numbering on removed library items is preserved without guessing.
- Upstream JSON exports do not include ledger additions. Use full PostgreSQL backups.
- Missing posters can use SIMKL's public image server; disable remote posters in settings for offline images.
